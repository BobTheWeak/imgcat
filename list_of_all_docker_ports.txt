We use the 97XX range of ports by default b/c it's not well-used
Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_TCP_and_UDP_port_numbers

The prod environment will use dynamic ports, spun up/down as needed. So these only apply to the fixed, single-instance, localdev version, running on dev machines, etc.

NOTE: All ports are separated by 2 numbers. This is to reserve the +1 port for testing a new release, config, etc.
